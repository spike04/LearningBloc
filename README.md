## What is BLoC?

Bloc is a StateManagement Package with Incorporates Separation of Concern by Separating State and Logic to Change State completely Different from UI Logic.

Here we are using the BLoC Package created By Felix Angelov along with the required Extensions in VsCode.

Along with BLoC, the project uses [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) Package By Remi Rousselet, creator of Famous [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) Package.

Added State Notifier to perform Same operation but flexibility Seems to be an issue with StateNotifier if we are to use it like that of bloc.
